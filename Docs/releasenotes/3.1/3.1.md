# Microsoft Sticky Notes 3.1 Release Notes

Over the last couple of weeks, weâ€™ve been testing an update to Sticky Notes in Skip Ahead. Today, weâ€™re excited to announce that weâ€™re rolling out that major update to everyone on Windows version 1809 and higher!
 

A few highlights in this version:
 
* We tested the waters with the Charcoal Note, and you all seemed keen to go even darker!  Introducing full-on Dark Mode support in Sticky Notes. We support Windows Dark Mode as well as the ability to set your color mode in Sticky Notes to suit your mood independent of your system settings.
* Everyone seemed excited about Sticky Notes syncing, so we spent some time making it even faster and more reliable! Check it out and let us know how it feels.

It has never been easier to access your Sticky Notes and Microsoft To-Do on your Android devices. Thanks to some help from our friends on the Launcher team, your Sticky Notes are available now on Microsoft Launcher Beta.
